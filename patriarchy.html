	<h1>Patriarchy</h1>
	<p>Patriarchy is an economic, political, cultural, and social system of domination of women that privileges men. Patriarchy is based on binary definitions of gender male/female with strict gender roles. Patriarchy also has rigidly enforced heterosexuality that places male/straight as superior and women/queer as inferior.
Patriarchy shapes and is shaped by white supremacy, capitalism and the State; together they form interlocking systems of oppression in the United States.
