	<h1>Internalized Racism</h1>
	<p>The poison of racism seeping into the psyches of people of color until people of color believe about themselves what whites believe about them that they are inferior to white people.
The behavior of one person of color toward another that stems from this psychic poisoning often called either interracial or intraracial hostility
The acceptance by peoples of color of Eurocentric values and norms i.e. straight hair, light skin.  This can include the belief in ethnic stereotypes relating to their own group. i.e. Blacks calling each other ‘nigga/ah/’.,  Differs from internalized white supremacy as that is how white people falsely believe in superiority as oppose to POC believing in their inferiority.

see Virginia Harris and Trinity Ordona developing unity among women of color
crossing the barriers of internalized racism and cross-racial hostility in making
face, making soul haciendo cara.
